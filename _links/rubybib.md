## [{{page.title}}](http://rubybib.org)

The Ruby Bibliograpy lists peer-reviewed research papers and articles
about modern programming language research 
(e.g. research into virtual machines, compilers and garbage collectors,
parallelism and concurrency, type systems,  etc.)
covering Ruby implementations or using Ruby.
The Ruby Bibliograpy also lists other notable papers that
don't mention Ruby but are applied in Ruby implementations.
