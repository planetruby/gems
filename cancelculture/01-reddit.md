# Ruby (October, 2021) - A Call for Tolerance On Ruby-Talk Results In Ban On Reddit Ruby

> You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ruby (because of your writing off / outside of r/ruby).
> I do not see your participation adding anything to this community.   
>
> -- Richard Schneeman (r/ruby Mod) 



Richard Schneeman sends on r/ruby where I have myself
self-censored because of an anti-crypto mob (the irony is that I am a
crypto-critic - by the way - and try to educate with code examples the
absurdity of it all and so on) and haven't posted anything for weeks -
yes, a permanent ban (because of a posting off / outside of r/ruby).

And to restate again and again I am not the poster of the
(harmless) joke. I was asking for (more) tolerance.


Anyways, for the record let's post the "out-of-the-blue" (private) message 
of the r/ruby ban sent by Richard Schneeman (the "lead" / "head" r/ruby Mod):

> You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ruby.

Editor's Note - I self-censored, that is, I deleted all last postings on r/ruby and stopped posting altogether for weeks now.
I even archived more than a dozen postings at a new reddit - see [r/planetruby](https://old.reddit.com/r/planetruby/).

Editor's Note -  The joke has been posted by a ruby newbie (yes, someone else).

Editor's Note - Warning about what? About have a different opinion!? 
It's a debate / discussion. Learn to respect different opinions / view points.

How absurd. Meanigful change in your behavior. I am asking for
tolerance and for sure that is not negotiable.

Anyways, not expecting any meaningful change from Richard
Schneeman. To repost my answer for the record:

If you read the thread I am NOT - repeat with me - I am NOT the poster of the
joke. I am asking for tolerance. But reading your
comments above it looks like you are [- sorry to say - an extreme illiberal fanatic leftie] on a "mission". You are targeting
the wrong random nobody (and remember every action will have reactions
and so on). And I thought you are acting in good faith [(when looking into how some haters game the r/ruby reddit 
with downvotes and flagging all post of targets as spam and so on)]. Helas. 

How can a posting about a joke (that I didn't post) on ruby-talk lead to a ban on r/ruby?      

Yes, a clear case for out-of-control cancel culture power abuse.   

Yes, I undestand - you, that is, Richard Schneeman  want to "signal" to your friends and co-workers how ultra / extreme leftie and righteous 
you are. 

Now - put yourself in my shoes - you see - taking the "unpopular" side and asking for more tolerance 
and standing up to the call-out about basically nothing (see the "joke" below) - how does that make you look
to your self-righteous leftie friends and co-worker, eh?

Q: What was the joke (I think most of us don't know it)?

The insanity of it all - here is the posting (not mine as stated before) [from the archive](https://rubytalk.org/t/simple-operations/75577):

Yes, that's all the drama.
Note the last line (above) a harmless statement about the vanity of older women (lying or being shy about their age or such).
