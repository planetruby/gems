# Ruby (January, 2023) - A Call for Good Governance @ Vienna.rb Results In Fuck You by Org / Owner (Aaron Cruz)


Thanks to Floor Drees the Vienna.rb meetups & governance was a model for excellence. 
Unfortunately Floor Drees moved back to the Netherlands years ago and 
the [Amsterdam.rb meetups](https://www.amsrb.org/) & governance today is - surprise, surprise - 
again a model for excellence.
 
What about Vienna.rb?  
Unfortunatley,  Aaron Cruz the new org is a complete disaster 
treating the meetup as a personal marketing / sales channel / funnel drumming up freelance contracts / business for himself
(or his buddies / inner-circle). That's now going on for years.

I called Aaron Cruz and his fig leaf and side kick Ramón Huidobro out in a series of three tickets
on the dead old vienna.rb website / github org.
See

- [Any Plans for Vienna Ruby Meetups in 2023? Ready-To-Help Out & Restart](https://github.com/vienna-rb/vienna-rb.github.com/issues/102),
- [Any Plans for the vienna.rb github org and the broken (dead) ruby vienna meetup website in 2023?](https://github.com/vienna-rb/vienna-rb.github.com/issues/103) and 
- [ruby.wien - This site can’t be reached](https://github.com/vienna-rb/vienna-rb.github.com/issues/104).

Aaron Cruz closed-up all tickets with a fuck you. The irony that Ramón Huidobro cherishes the non-negotiable code of conduct
of the old Vienna.rb website / github org while declaring a code of (good) governance as unthinkable.
Anyways, all I was asking for was really not much more than:

1. A Good Governance Model - Yes, END the dictatorship and FUCK YOU declarations by Aaron Cruz etc.
2. Let's Update & Bring Back the Website (GitHub Org) - since nobody is left standing - let's start over at github.com/viennarb and transfer the repos to save the heritage and close down the duplicate not in operation anyway.


Anyways, yet another big fail in community building / support in rubyland.
To wrap-up on a positve note  I updated the github org that I started years back as a back-up, 
see [Vienna.rb / Wien.rb - Ruby Meetup / Stammtisch in Vienna, Austria](https://viennarb.github.io/) 
and I invite you to join if interested an upcoming (drop-in) ruby meetup in 2023!
